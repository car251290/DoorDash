About DoorDash Drive
DoorDash Drive enables you to use DoorDash's on-demand logistics platform and fleet of Dashers to deliver your goods quickly and easily, without the hassle of staffing your own delivery fleet. Whether you need flexible fulfillment for overflow or a consistent on-demand delivery service, our platform is designed to work with your business.


Integration process overview
Here's what you can expect for the integration process:

You'll generate an access key that will allow you to access our sandbox environment.
You'll use the delivery simulator and API documentation to build your integration. The development timeline is entirely up to your team's own roadmap. We're here to support you as needed!
Once you've completed development and are ready to go live, you'll submit a quick request for production access.
The DoorDash team will review your request and reach out within a few days to schedule a demo of your finished product.
The DoorDash team will provide an update ASAP on your approval status. Once approved, you can generate a production key and begin requesting real deliveries immediately.
Use the menu on the left to navigate through our documentation or jump right into the API reference using the menu in the top-right corner. Happy building!

## Get started (Postman)

Wrapping up
If you’ve made it this far, you are ready to start adding delivery capabilities to your app and help your business reach an entirely new market!

Join the Postman API Network and share your APIs to 20M+ users in the world’s largest public API hub or book a call with one of Postman API Network Evangelists to learn more.


## Making Developers Productive
Bobby Abraham manages Developer Strategy & Operations at DoorDash and is primarily focused on working with partner development teams to onboard developers onto Drive. In an effort to make the developer experience immersive and seamless, Bobby decided to leverage the power of the Postman API Network. He created a DoorDash Public Workspace that would allow DoorDash to tap into Postman’s 20 million registered users in a central place. Here, Drive could get easy access to and be discovered by API consumers and API producers, providing merchants with a cost-effective way to deliver products directly to customers on demand.

I thought the Postman Public API Network would be a great way to spread awareness of DoorDash Drive and provide a delightful experience for our developers. The Postman team was great in helping us understand how to optimize our documentation to serve our developer partners better. Bobby Abraham, Developer Strategy & Operations at DoorDash


## Connect client to the server
When passing data between a Server and Client Component through props, the data is still serialized (converted to a string) for use in the browser. However, it does not need a special type. It’s typed the same as passing any other props between components.
